# Note: An event is any action that occurs during the event loop that might
# trigger some behavior in the application, such as when a key or mouse button is pressed.
# When an event occurs, an event object is emitted, which means that an
# instance of a class representing the event is instantiated. You donâ€™t need to worry about
# creating these classes yourself. Tkinter will create instances of event classes for you automatically.
